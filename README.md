# 3-Password-Generator
The password generator is a webpage. When given different criteria it returns a randomly generated password. 

The html and css of this assignment was given. However, I created a script that returned a randomly generated password. 

The script prompts users to choose which criteria they want in their passwords. It then creates a password that meets those criteria. I used variables and arrays to store information. Then I used the random function to generate the password. The script can be found in the script.js file.
